So to explain the project briefly

So we're planning to work on a discord bot and website that can fetch previous year question papers of VIT internal exams as a student resource. No one has ever made a public repository of such other than shady telegram channels so we'll get some real gratitude points + a solid portfolio project apart from the obvious learning experience (and QPs of course)

So the plan is :

- Building an API via express that can store categorised links and PDFs.
- A discord bot service (uses discord py) that provides question papers and resources to engineering students, which is sourced from the aforementioned API.
- A website that can provide the same, fetched from the same API which also holds a link to invite the bot.
- Branding the whole project along with optimisation of the website UI/UX


The data will primarily be sourced from VIT internal exams but other students and teachers can use them as reference materials as well.

If you're a VIT student willing to contribute please shoot me a DM at Outlaw0125#3298 on discord.
