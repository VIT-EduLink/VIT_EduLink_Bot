I'll just explain the project briefly

So we're planning to work on a discord bot and website that can fetch previous year question papers of VIT internal exams as a student resource. No one has ever made a public repository of such other than shady telegram channels so we'll get some real gratitude points + a solid portfolio project apart from the obvious learning experience (and QPs of course)

So the plan is :
A discord bot service that provides question papers and resources to engineering students.
The data will primarily be sourced from VIT internal exams but other students and teachers can use them as reference materials as well.
